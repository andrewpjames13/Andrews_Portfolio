        Cart-Driver is an wood fire pizza and oyster bar in Denver's Rhino district.
        Inspired by the Italian Autogrill, Cart-Driver approached me to do an illustration
        for their signage that would show the roots and insperation behind the restaurant.
        If your in the 25th and Larimer area stop in and get a taste of their amazing pizza
        and hospitality... oh and dont forget to try the wood fire vanilla ice cream its wild.
